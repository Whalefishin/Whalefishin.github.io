<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I was born and raised in Shenzhen, China and came to the US at the age of 14. I attended Swarthmore College for undergrad and went on to get a math PhD from RPI. I worked with Dr. [Rongjie Lai](https://sites.google.com/view/rongjielai/home?authuser=0) to explore connections between deep generative models and mean-field games. My research interests include but are not limited to:
- generative models
- mean-field games/control
- optimal transport
- language models
- operator learning

In earlier parts of my research career, I studied computational models for the brain with Dr. [Victor Barranca](https://barranca.domains.swarthmore.edu/). 


I'll be a research scientist at Meta starting on July 22nd, 2024. It looks like my job will involve building recommendation systems used for ads and feeds, but I haven't started yet so who knows?

I love video games and write about them regularly here.
